# Salesforce Headless 360 CLI

**Portable Salesforce Customer 360 context for agents: signed, FLS-gated, locally inspectable, and Slack-aware.**

Salesforce has strong APIs, Agentforce MCP, and Salesforce DX MCP. Those tools are often the right answer. Salesforce Headless 360 exists for the narrower job they do not center: emitting one verifiable Customer 360 artifact that an agent can read offline, verify before use, and inject into collaboration surfaces without widening the audience. Run `doctor` first; if Agentforce MCP or DX MCP already covers the job, this CLI will say so.

No telemetry. `doctor` is local. All logs are local.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli/...@latest
```

The primary binary is `salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli`. The MCP server binary is `salesforce-headless-360-pp-mcp`.

## Quick Start

This path verifies the CLI in under a minute without a Salesforce account:

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli doctor --mock
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent context 001ACME0001 --dry-run --json
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli which "verify a signed salesforce bundle"
```

Expected result: `doctor --mock` reports green rows for REST, Data Cloud, Slack linkage, Slack Web API, trust key store, Apex companion, local store, sf CLI passthrough, and competing-tool checks.

## Killer Commands

- `agent context` packages one Account plus Contacts, Opportunities, Cases, Tasks, Events, Chatter, Files, optional Data Cloud profile, and linked Slack channels into a signed bundle.
- `agent verify` checks the bundle JWS, expiration, manifest SHA, live key status, and optional ContentVersion byte hashes before an agent trusts the file.
- `agent inject` posts a bundle summary to Slack only after intersecting Salesforce FLS across the Slack channel audience.

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent context 001xx000003DGb2AAG --since P90D --output acme.json
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent verify acme.json --strict
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent inject --slack C123456 --bundle acme.json
```

## Unique Features

### Agent Context Packager

The core workflow is a signed JSON artifact rather than another live API session. An agent can receive `acme.json`, verify it offline, inspect provenance, and avoid making repeated Salesforce calls during reasoning.

### Trust And Compliance

The trust path combines device keys, Salesforce-hosted public keys, bundle audit rows, compliance redaction counters, and optional deep file-byte verification. The security design is documented in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) instead of being left as README shorthand.

### Competing-Tool Yield

Doctor treats Agentforce MCP and Salesforce DX MCP as first-class neighboring tools. When either one is configured, the CLI reports that you may not need this CLI for overlapping work.

## Authentication

- `auth login --sf <alias>` reuses Salesforce CLI credentials and requires `sf` version `2.60.0` or newer.
- `auth login --web --client-id <id>` uses a loopback OAuth web flow with PKCE.
- `auth login --jwt --org <alias>` supports CI, but bundle emission requires `agent context --run-as-user <UserId>` so reads are scoped to the acting user.

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli auth login --sf prod
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli auth login --web --client-id "$SF_CLIENT_ID" --org sandbox
SF360_AUTH_METHOD=jwt salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent context 001xx000003DGb2AAG --run-as-user 005xx00000ABCDE
```

Profiles are stored under `~/.config/pp/salesforce-headless-360/profiles/`. Token material is local.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `accounts get`, `accounts list` | Read Account records through Salesforce REST-style access. |
| `contacts get`, `contacts list` | Read Contact records linked to accounts or queries. |
| `opportunities get`, `opportunities list` | Read deal records for bundle and brief workflows. |
| `cases list`, `tasks list`, `events list` | Read service and activity context for Customer 360 assembly. |
| `sync` | Hydrate the local SQLite store for offline bundle assembly and analytics. |
| `search` | Search locally synced Salesforce context. |
| `analytics` | Aggregate locally synced records without another Salesforce round trip. |
| `trust register`, `trust list-keys`, `trust revoke` | Manage bundle signing keys and org trust roots. |
| `agent context`, `agent brief`, `agent decay`, `agent verify`, `agent inject` | Build, summarize, score, verify, and safely share agent-context artifacts. |
| `doctor` | Check local readiness and optional source availability. |
| `which` | Resolve a natural-language capability query to the best CLI command. |

Run `salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli --help` or `salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli <command> --help` for flags.

## Output Formats

Human terminal output is optimized for scanning. Piped or agent-oriented output should use `--json`, `--compact`, or `--agent`.

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli accounts list --json
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli accounts list --json --select id,name,owner.name
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent decay --account 001xx000003DGb2AAG --json
```

Commands that read data return a provenance envelope when applicable. Parse `.results` for records and `.meta.source` to distinguish live Salesforce reads from local cache reads.

## Cookbook

### Verify Before Acting

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli trust register --org prod
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent context 001xx000003DGb2AAG --since P30D --output acme.json
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent verify acme.json --strict
```

### Meeting Prep

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent brief --opp 006xx000001ABCDE --json
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent context 001xx000003DGb2AAG --dry-run
```

### Freshness Triage

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli sync --account 001xx000003DGb2AAG
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent decay --account 001xx000003DGb2AAG --json
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli analytics --type opportunities --group-by stage --limit 10
```

### Insight-Native Agent Commands

`agent decay` returns a freshness score and signal breakdown. `agent brief` returns narrative markdown plus structured JSON. `analytics` aggregates synced data locally so agents can reason over a stable cache instead of paginating live APIs.

## Agent Usage

`--agent` expands to machine-oriented defaults: JSON output, compact formatting, no prompts, no color, and affirmative confirmation for commands that need explicit non-interactive approval. Use it when an LLM, MCP client, shell script, or scheduled job is the caller.

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent context 001xx000003DGb2AAG --dry-run --agent
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli doctor --agent
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli agent-context --pretty
```

## FLS And Trust Model

- FLS enforcement is applied before records enter bundles, sync output, Data Cloud enrichment, or Slack linkage summaries.
- Device-scoped Ed25519 keys sign bundles, while org-registered public keys live in Salesforce Certificate records when available and CMDT records as a fallback.
- File-byte attestation stores ContentVersion SHA-256 values in the manifest, and `agent verify --deep` re-hashes bytes when Salesforce auth is available.
- JWT and Bulk paths require the Apex companion or `--run-as-user` guard because integration-user permissions are not a safe FLS boundary.

Read the full trust and threat model in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md). HIPAA deployment guidance is in [docs/hipaa.md](docs/hipaa.md).

## MCP Usage

- `salesforce-headless-360-pp-mcp` exposes agent-context, brief, decay, verify, refresh, and doctor tools for MCP-compatible clients.
- `doctor` detects Agentforce MCP and Salesforce DX MCP via environment variables and local MCP registries, then frames overlapping coverage as "you may not need this CLI."

Claude Code example:

```bash
salesforce-headless-360-pp-cli auth login --sf prod
claude mcp add salesforce-headless-360 salesforce-headless-360-pp-mcp
```

Claude Desktop example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce-headless-360": {
      "command": "salesforce-headless-360-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Editions Supported

| Edition | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | Yes | Certificate-backed trust registration is the preferred path. |
| Unlimited | Yes | Same trust and audit model as Enterprise. |
| Developer Edition | Yes | Good for local validation, mock flows, and package testing. |
| Professional Edition | Caveat | Certificate APIs may be unavailable; use CMDT fallback only after reviewing [docs/security.md](docs/security.md). |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `2` | Usage error |
| `3` | Resource not found |
| `4` | Authentication required |
| `5` | Salesforce or upstream API error |
| `7` | Rate limited |
| `10` | Configuration error |

## Troubleshooting

- `doctor --mock` should be your first smoke test; it removes Salesforce, Slack, local keystore, and sf CLI availability from the equation.
- `SF360.AUTH.JWT_NO_RUN_AS_USER` means JWT mode tried to emit a bundle without a user-scoping flag.
- `agent verify` with an unknown key means the bundle signer is not present in the local keystore; run `trust register --org <alias>`.
- Data Cloud, Slack linkage, and Slack Web API yellow rows mean optional enrichments are unavailable, not that REST Customer 360 reads are blocked.

## FAQ

### Does this replace Agentforce MCP or Salesforce DX MCP?

No. If those tools cover your task directly, use them. This CLI is for portable signed context bundles, offline verification, and Slack audience-safety workflows.

### Where is the live verification report?

The live verification report will live at [docs/live-verification-report.md](docs/live-verification-report.md). Unit J owns that artifact.

### Does this CLI send telemetry?

No. Feedback, doctor output, logs, tokens, profiles, keystores, bundle audit cache rows, and generated bundles are local unless you explicitly configure an outbound sink or Slack injection.

### How do README claims map to code?

See [docs/README-claim-map.md](docs/README-claim-map.md). Every bullet claim in this README maps to an implementation path and a test path.

## Sources And Inspiration

Salesforce Headless 360 is designed to coexist with Salesforce's official APIs, Salesforce CLI, Agentforce MCP, and Salesforce DX MCP. The trust posture is documented so an operator can decide when this CLI is unnecessary.
