# Printing Press Library

Printing Press Library is the published catalog for the [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press): agent-friendly CLIs, MCP servers, and plugin skills generated from real APIs and shipped as installable tools.

This repository currently includes 21 CLIs, 19 MCP servers, one mega-skill (`/ppl`), and 21 focused `pp-*` skills.

## Start Here

This repo is its own Claude Code plugin marketplace. Add the marketplace, then install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/printing-press-library
/plugin install printing-press-library@printing-press-library
```

After install, the main router skill is:

```text
/ppl
```

That naming split is intentional:

- The repository and plugin are named `printing-press-library`
- The mega-skill you actually use is `/ppl`

If you also want to generate new tools from API specs, install the source project too:

```text
/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/cli-printing-press
/plugin install cli-printing-press@cli-printing-press
```

## Quick Examples

```text
/ppl
/ppl sports scores
/ppl install espn cli
/ppl install espn mcp
/ppl espn lakers score
/ppl linear my open issues
/pp-espn lakers score
/pp-weather-goat phoenix forecast
```

Use `/ppl` when you want discovery, routing, or installation. Use a focused `pp-*` skill when you already know the tool you want.

## What This Repo Ships

- [`skills/ppl/SKILL.md`](skills/ppl/SKILL.md): the mega-skill that browses the catalog, installs CLIs and MCP servers, and routes user requests to the right tool
- [`skills/`](skills/): one focused skill per published tool, such as `pp-espn`, `pp-linear`, and `pp-weather-goat`
- [`library/`](library/): the actual Go modules for each CLI and MCP server
- [`registry.json`](registry.json): the machine-readable source of truth for the published catalog
- [`.claude-plugin/`](.claude-plugin/): the marketplace and plugin manifests — the whole repo is the plugin

The top-level README is the human guide. `registry.json` is the authoritative index.

## Installation Paths

### Recommended: let `/ppl` handle it

```text
/ppl install <name> cli
/ppl install <name> mcp
```

That keeps users off of repo-path trivia and lets the skill read from [`registry.json`](registry.json).

### Direct CLI install

You need [Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/dl/).

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/<path>/cmd/<binary>@latest
```

Examples:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/project-management/linear/cmd/linear-pp-cli@latest
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/weather-goat/cmd/weather-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

### Direct MCP install

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/<path>/cmd/<mcp-binary>@latest
claude mcp add <mcp-binary> -- <mcp-binary>
```

Examples:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add espn-pp-mcp -- espn-pp-mcp

go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/weather-goat/cmd/weather-goat-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add weather-goat-pp-mcp -- weather-goat-pp-mcp
```

If a tool needs credentials, the focused skill and the tool README document the required environment variables.

Each published tool is self-contained: source code, a local README, provenance metadata, and manuscripts from the printing run.

## What "Endorsed" Means

Every published tool in this repo has passed:

1. Generation from an API spec or captured interface through the CLI Printing Press
2. Validation checks such as build, vet, help, and version
3. Provenance capture through `.printing-press.json` and `.manuscripts/`

Some tools are refined after generation. The generated artifacts remain in the tool directory so the provenance stays inspectable.
